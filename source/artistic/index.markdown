This page demonstrates my enthusiasm and amateur pursuit of art.

I am also an amateur designer. Have a look at the logos I designed for various events. I'm not sure whether they are good, but some people really like them.

##[A Tour to FOX Theater]({{ root_url }}/artistic/fox)
I love musicals! During my 3-week short staying in Atlanta, I went to see three musicals. FOX theater is a great theater and left me wonderful memories.

##[Extremely amatuer guitar play]({{ root_url }}/artistic/guitar)
I learned guitar in my spare time. I'm extremely amatuer and still a noob.
