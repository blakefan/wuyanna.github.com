###What was your most rewarding experience contributing to Mifos this summer?
Being a part of mifos community is amazing. I learned a lot from the code of MifosX and from my mentor. For example, my mentor taught me how to write unit tests with the help of some good tools and how test-driven development could make a difference on my code design. The final code review is also rewarding. I learned the importance of following code conventions, especially for open source projects. Besides that, experiencing how open source projects operate with contributors across the world is very interesting.

###What was your biggest challenge you overcame this summer? 
My summer schedule is little intense for me, but I managed to keep the work on track. The daily and weekly routines help me make progress everyday and eliminate procrastination.

###What advice would give to other students/GSoC interns on working with Mifos?
The community is quick in response and willing to help. It also gives you a lot of freedom in doing your project. You will have the opportunity to present your work to a large group of Mifos users. Take ownership of your project and you will feel rewarded and accomplished in the end.


###If you could visit the country of one of our Mifos users, where would it be and why? 
If possible, I would love to visit my mentor's home country, Ghana. There's something interesting: when we had skype meetings, I could always hear the sounds of various animals, which interested me a lot. I think it is a great place to visit.

###If you have time, how do you hope to contribute to Mifos in the future? 
I would be glad to continue contribute to Mifos as a developer in the future. 


###What will you be doing now that Summer of Code is complete?
Focus on coursework.
