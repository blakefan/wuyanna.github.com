The team bounding period came to an end, and the coding starts! During these few weeks of formal participating in the team's weekly routines, I was impressed by how efficient and organised the team worked. I once thought that since mifos, as any common open source community, does not make profit and give pays to contributors, there probably were just a few volunteers scattered all over the world making some commits based on their interest during their free time. I found I was totally wrong when having witnessed the team operating in such an ordered and methodical way. 

Using Git is no surprise. It is a great tool for collaboration, especially for open source projects. Project issues are tracked and managed by JIRA system. There are several volunteers testing the master branch code according to test cases every day and bugs are reported on JIRA with great details. Some bugs are assigned to specific person, some are left open to volunteers all over the world. I worked out several issues when I was applying for gsoc. The team's immediate and careful responses were out of my expectation. That was also one of the most important reason that I chose mifos over other open source community.

Each week we have a developer meeting or a user meeting. During the biweekly user meeting, a presentation was given by a volunteer on a wide range of topics from the scholar researches to product design and to user showcase. Many of the users are from Africa and Mideast. 'Fighting against poverty' is not just a slogan, but what mifos is actually achieving. It is wonderful to work for such a community.
