The kitten is flying with a propeller! Watch out for the birds and flyers! They are dangerous. Pilot Cat will encounter a lot of challenges in the air. Mouse Down to make the cat fly up, mouse up to drop the cat. Do NOT fly too high into the clouds or fall down into the ocean. Avoid other flying objects in the sky.Good Luck!
