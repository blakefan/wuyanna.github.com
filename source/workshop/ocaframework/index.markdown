OCAFramework (Objective-C Common Application Framework) is an IOS application framework written in Objective-C. This framework is designed to facilitate the developing process of IOS applications. It strictly follows the design pattern of MVC (Model-View-Controller) and covers UI components and base infrastructures that are common IOS application development. I made this framework through the experience of several IOS projects. It is now open source on [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/ocaframework).
