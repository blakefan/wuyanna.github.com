    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It feels so good to be a part of this event. Coding, open source, Google, $, all sound so cool to me.;)</p>

<p>The applying process is struggling at first. Choosing the right project to work on is never an easy job, but once I made up my mind, all I need to do is getting involved in the project.</p>

<p>The open source community I joined is Mifos, a managing platform for microfinance institute. I've never heard of it before applying to gsoc, but it caught my eyes from a fairly long list of participating organizations because I was once so into finance at college. I read financial reports of listed companies and analyzed their k-chart. I even got the Certificate of Securities Qualifications. Let bygones be bygones. I started contributing to mifosx, and this community really surprised me. I felt respect, belongingness and ownership while participating in the community. In fact, it has far more volunteers around the world than I previously thought.</p>

<p>The project I will work on is XBRL reporting integration. <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/wuyanna/1">Here</a>'s my proposal for the project.</p>
